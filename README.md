WGCinema Software is a university project developed collaboratively by our group, **"Wonderful Guys" (WG)**.

- This project uses **MySQL** as the database and is built with **Gradle**.
- Run the project using the command `gradle run`. Refer to the Gradle documentation for more information.
- All database connections, keys, and values are located in the `.env` file. On the first run, execute `cp app.env.example app.env` and set your keys and values in `.env`.
